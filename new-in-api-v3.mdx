## New User Data Object

API v3.0 introduces (/users) as an endpoint bringing students, teachers, staff, district admins, and contacts under one object, individually queryable by adding a role type parameter e.g., /users?role=teacher). 

### Identity API

#### Changed

* The `type` field on `/me` will now return `"user"` for any user records instead of a specific role type.

### Data API

#### Added

Users record type, which replaces District Admins, Staff (formerly known as School Admins), Teachers, and Students, and associated endpoints

* GET `/users`  
   * `role` parameter, which can be used to filter responses to users that have a specific role
* GET `/schools/{id}/users`  
   * `role` parameter, which can be used to filter responses to users that have a specific role
* GET `/sections/{id}/users`  
   * `role` parameter, which can be used to filter responses to users that have a specific role
* GET `/users/{id}`
* GET `/users/{id}/district`
* GET `/users/{id}/schools`
* GET `/users/{id}/myteachers`
* GET `/users/{id}/mystudents`
* GET `/users/{id}/mycontacts`
* GET `/users/{id}/sections`
* GET `/users/{id}/resources`
* Contacts now return `student_relationships`, which defines the Contact's `type` and `relationship` with a specific `student`. This replaces the previous top-level `type` and `relationship` fields
* Staff records return `roles`, which shows the permissions this user has in Clever.
* Staff records can now be accessed on a per-school basis  
   * GET `/schools/{id}/users?role=staff`
* GET `/schools/{id}/users` returns all users for the specified school, even if the school is not the primary school for the user
* Terms and Courses can now be accessed on a per-school basis  
   * GET `/schools/{id}/courses`  
   * GET `/schools/{id}/terms`  
   * GET `/courses/{id}/schools`  
   * GET `/terms/{id}/schools`

### Changed

* `/schools/{id}/users` returns all users associated with that school, even if their primary school is not {id}

## Content Mapping API
