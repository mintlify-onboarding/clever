> Even though your dev app comes with a pre-populated, pre-created sandbox district, it‚Äôs important that you test with a demo teacher from a district in Clever that is **_not connected at the district level_** to your development app. This will provide a representative test of a signup experience from a Clever teacher who is not currently shared by a school or district.
> 
> Also, note that school and district administrators **do not have permissions** to log in to your application via Clever Library, as a teacher is limited to only sharing his/her classroom data. Administrators must be shared at the district level to access an application.

### Testing with your Clever Dashboard's Integration Guide

You can test a single teacher and student flow with the Integration Guide located in your Clever Dashboard.

Navigate to your the section entitled Fetch data via the Clever API and select the user type you would like to test with. This will simulate a login with by directing a user connected to our internally managed sandbox district to the redirect URI you have configured in your Instant Login settings.

Once you have successfully completed this login, you can test with additional users following the steps below.

### Testing with multiple users

Follow the steps below to simulate incoming teacher signups by using a ‚ÄúSign Up with Clever‚Äù URL below. 

We‚Äôve created a sandbox district just for this purpose with test teacher and student accounts for you to test with. The sandbox contains multiple teacher accounts with corresponding classes and students and has district ID = `5b2ad81a709e300001e2cd7a`. To make the testing process simpler, we can add a `district_id` param on the end of the URL to skip the school picker and go straight to the sandbox district's login page:

`https://clever.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&redirect_uri={YOUR REDIRECT URI}&client_id={YOUR CLIENT ID}&district_id=5b2ad81a709e300001e2cd7a`

This will automatically take you to the login screen for the sandbox district:

### The Teacher Experience

We've created a number of identical test teachers with classes that you can use to test your integration with. These teachers each teach 3 classes with 1, 2, and 2 students respectively.

Teacher username = **_teacherX_** where _X_ is a number beween 1-20, e.g. _teacher1_  
Teacher password = **_clever_**

After you log in, you'll see the OAuth consent screen:

When we log into the example app above using _teacher1_, we can see that the teacher account has been provisioned and data synced:

### The Student Experience

To test the student experience, you must use a student that has already been shared by his/her teacher. So if you used _teacher1_ initially, you'll need to log in with a student from _teacher1_.

Student username = **_studentX-Y_** where _X_ is the teacher number and _Y_ is between 1-5, e.g. _student1-1_  
Student password = **_clever_**
