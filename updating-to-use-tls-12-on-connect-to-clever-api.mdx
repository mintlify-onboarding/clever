title: "Updating to use TLS 1.2 on connection to Clever API"
---

## Better Data Transport Security

Starting **August 16th 2021**, the Clever API requires calling code and programs to use TLS 1.2 (Transport Layer Security). Code and packages using TLS 1.0 or 1.1 can no longer make requests to api.clever.com.

By moving away from outdated and insecure TLS 1.0 and 1.1 protocols, which have known weaknesses, Clever wants to make sure that our users’ data is transported with better security via our API endpoints. This migration elevates the security posture of Clever and our application partners, and ultimately helps ensure private data of millions of teachers and students who rely on Clever are well protected.

Below are tips and tools to use when migrating to TLS 1.2 with major tech stacks.

## Java

**If your application runs on Java 1.7 or Java 1.6** (update 111 or later), you can set the _https.protocols system property_ when starting the JVM to enable additional protocols for connections made using the HttpsURLConnection class – for example, by setting

```Java Java
Dhttps.protocols=TLSv1.2
```

**If your application runs on Java 1.6 prior to update 111, or earlier**, TLS 1.1 and 1.2 are not supported. Therefore, you need to update the version of Java your application runs on.

If you use another library for connections such as _Apache HttpClient_, see the Apache-HttpClient section below. 

## Apache-HttpClient

Please leverage SSLConnectionSocketFactory to set the TLS version on your connections. See this helpful [guide](https://www.baeldung.com/apache-httpclient-tls) for details.

```Java Java
SSLConnectionSocketFactory sslsf = new SSLConnectionSocketFactory(
  SSLContexts.createDefault(),
  new String[] { "TLSv1.2" },
  null,
  SSLConnectionSocketFactory.getDefaultHostnameVerifier());
CloseableHttpClient httpClient = HttpClients.custom().setSSLSocketFactory(sslsf).build();
```

## Jakarta Commons-HttpClient

This package has reached its [end of life](https://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/features.html). Please upgrade to use Apache-HTTPClient and follow the guide above to make sure you use TLS 1.2

## .NET

## Built-In Client

If you are using a builtin .NET client to make requests to Clever’s API, please see [this detailed guide ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/network-programming/tls#%23configuring-security-via-appcontext-switches-for-net-framework-46-or-later-versions) on how to upgrade to TLS 1.2 across various versions of .NET framework. 

## RestSharp

If you are using [RestSharp](https://app.launchdarkly.com/) to communicate with Clever, you will need to add the following line above the first request you make to Clever. See the [issue here](https://github.com/restsharp/RestSharp/issues/1075) for relevant discussion.

```Text Text
ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol = SecurityProtocolType.Tls12 | SecurityProtocolType.Tls11 | SecurityProtocolType.Tls;
```

## Python

## urllib3

If you are using the Urllib3 package with python 3.6, please use pyOpenSSL package to make sure you can upgrade to TLS 1.2.

```Python Python
python3 -m pip3 install pyOpenSSL
```

In [certain cases](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/contrib/pyopenssl.html#module-urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl), you might have to opt into using pyOpenSSL by the following:

```Python Python
import urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl
urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl.inject_into_urllib3()
```

## libcurl

If you are using Ubuntu, you will need to take package updates. You can do this by running the following:

```Python Python
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade openssl
```

You may also need to update your libssl. You can update this by running:

```Python Python
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade libssl-dev
```

If you are using RedHat Enterprise Linux, or CentOS:

```Python Python
sudo yum update openssl libcurl
```

### Go

If you are using a newer version of go ( Go 1.13 or above), Go already supports TLS 1.2 by default, so you will not need to make any changes.

When using older version of Go, make sure to set your TLS Client Configuration’s MinVersion to explicitly use TLS 1.2.

```css Go
TLSClientConfig: &tls.Config{
        MinVersion: tls.VersionTLS12,
    }
```

If you are using the fasthttp library, please follow the instructions in this issue to properly create a [TLS configuration](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp/issues/431).
