## What is Clever Certification?

Clever wants to help you design and build an excellent integration so that you can deliver an unparalleled experience for the users that you serve. We want to make sure that when you go live with Clever, we're delivering the best possible experience for both your customers and your team.

It's important that integrations are secure, resilient, and scalable. To that end, based on our experience working with application partners across the country, we've devised a set of core requirements that integrations must meet in order to connect with live districts and access production data, including user records and enrollment information.

The specific requirements for each are detailed in the following pages.

After you build and test your integration with a Clever development app, we ask you to submit a survey answering key questions about how it works. We will then review your survey responses and your integration for architectural best practices.

## Why Should I Certify?

* Connect with real users
* Make things easier for your customers
* Ensure that your integration will work in the Clever ecosystem
* Be featured in the [Clever Application Gallery](https://clever.com/app-gallery)
* Earn certification image assets you can use on your website
