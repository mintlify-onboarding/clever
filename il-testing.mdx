### Before you start testing...

* Have you implemented [Instant Login with OAuth 2.0?](/docs/identity-api)?
* Have you configured your redirect URLs?

### Testing Individual Users

### Using sandbox user credentials

If you're using Clever's default sandbox district (auto-connected with your application):

1. Initiate a login. You can do this one of three ways:
* Go to the district overview in your Clever dashboard. Copy the Portal URL, and after logging in, click your application's icon.
* Go to the district overview in your Clever dashboard. Copy the Instant Login link and log in there.
* Use a Log in with Clever button.
1. All sandboxes should be set up so the default credentials are:
* Student: username and password are the student's `student_number` (e.g., 243615677)
* Teacher: username and password are the teacher's `teacher_number` (e.g., 215041)
* School admin: username and password are the school admin's `staff_id` (e.g., 12342)
* District admins may only be tested in [custom sandbox districts](/docs/custom-sandbox-districts).

You can download the default district CSVs to test other users [here](https://assets.clever.com/devdocs/default%5Fsandbox%5Fdata.zip).

If you're using a [custom sandbox](/docs/custom-sandbox-districts) district instead, you must configure and review your Single Sign On user credentials settings.

### Secure Sync only: SSO debugging tools

In the Data Browser, open up the Detail View for a user where there is a link to log in as the user. This link sends a user-authenticated request to your app, so you can see what the user sees when they access your app through Clever.

This works for all user types that your application supports: students, teachers, school and district admins.
