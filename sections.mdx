### Related objects

Each section has a primary school and contains students and teacher objects. But be careful, the students and teachers may have a different primary school than the section. For example, an elementary student may be enrolled in a middle school math class.

You'll notice that the section has a `teacher` field as well as a list of `teachers`. If a section has more than one teacher, additional teachers are listed in the `teachers` array. We recommend importing all teachers, not just the primary teacher.
