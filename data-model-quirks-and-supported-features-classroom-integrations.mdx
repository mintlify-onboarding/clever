Data in Clever can experience a number of edge cases listed below. Although these are not typical cases, it's a good idea to be prepared for these to occur. If your integration cannot handle any of these cases, please reach out to [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6c050218090b1e0d180503021f2c0f00091a091e420f0301) to reflect this in our documentation so that our support team can better support our shared customers.
