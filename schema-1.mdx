#### Field Formats

| Field         | Field Description                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Object ID** | All Clever IDs take the ObjectID format. We guarantee that ObjectIDs are globally unique across districts and User objects.                                   |
| **String**    | Clever's strings have no maximum length - if you have to set maximum character lengths for fields, we recommend setting the max to 255 characters for safety. |
| **Date**      | We normalize dates in Clever to YYYY-MM-DD: "2015-08-25"                                                                                                      |
| **Timestamp** | Timestamps are expressed in this format: "2015-08-25T00:00:00.000Z"                                                                                           |
| **Boolean**   | Booleans have a value of either "Y" or "N"                                                                                                                    |
