Let's examine the tail end of the JSON response to `/me` while using a student instant login token. Here's an example links node:

JSON

`"links":
  [
    { "rel":"self","uri":"/me" },
    { "rel":"canonical","uri":"/v3.0/users/4fee004cca2e43cf2700028b" },
    { "rel":"district","uri":"/v3.0/districts/4feecb637de9810111e000002" }
  ]
`

Each relative link is structured:

**`rel`** \- a string containing a keyword describing why you might be interested in the uri part  
**`uri`** \- a string containing the path component of a Clever API request

The rel keyword you're most interested in while handling this step is canonical. This is a fancy way of saying that the primary way to retrieve information about the object described in your API request is by requesting the path in the uri key.

* To use that uri, you would attach the path component to `https://api.clever.com`.
* In the above canonical example, that would be `https://api.clever.com/v3.0/users/4fee004cca2e43cf2700028b`.
* This path will be accessible using the same instant login token or the appropriate district bearer token.
