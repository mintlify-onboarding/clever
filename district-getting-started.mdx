Clever Secure Sync lets you sync data from every SIS with one integration - instead of building a separate connector for OneRoster files, PowerSchool, Aeries, Skyward, Infinite Campus, eSchoolPlus (and so on), you can quickly provision accounts and use that time to improve your core product.

### Secure Sync

Secure Sync allows you to access information about users and provision accounts in advance; Classroom-only applications have access to user information only when the user logs in through IL.

Secure Sync also gives access to roster information - student-teacher associations and classroom data.

### Getting started with Secure Sync

First, check out [Clever's Data Model](/docs/data-model) to understand how data is organized in Clever. There are three major components to a solid Secure Sync integration:

1. Onboarding districts - identifying the district-app token and preparing to ingest data
2. Initial sync - matching existing data and provisioning accounts for the first time
3. Ongoing sync - handling changes to data on an ongoing basis, including semester and school-year rollover

We'll go over best practices for each of these pieces in the next three pages.
