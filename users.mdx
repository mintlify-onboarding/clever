> Important information about student contact data
> 
> While we offer student contact information, it is not normalized in the same way that other data is in Clever. Please note:
> 
> * The quality and formatting of student contact data can vary between SISs
> * Contacts without `sis_id` populated are not stable - if any data on the contact changes (such as name, email, or phone number), the contact will be deleted and a new one will be created with a new Clever ID.
