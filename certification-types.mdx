## Types of Certifications

There are three types of Clever integrations and there is a certification process for each. 

The three options are:

1. Clever Library
2. District Single Sign-on (SSO)
3. Rostering (Secure Sync)

They are listed below. If you are unsure which integration type you need to build, please fill out the following form to help inform your decision:

### Library

**Library**  integrations are teacher-initiated. Teachers can add your application through the [Clever Library](https://clever.com/library). Teachers can then provision accounts on-demand for themselves as well as the students who are enrolled in their classes. 

Through this integration type, the application receives the **teacher name, teacher email, student first name and last initial, as well as section (class) information**. 

To learn more about the Library Certification process, see [Library Certification Guide](/v0.31/docs/library-certification-guide)

### District SSO

**District SSO** integrations are managed by district administrators. Your application can be added through the _Request Application_ page of the district dashboard. This integration should facilitate SSO into your application for any Clever user that has been scoped by a district administrator. 

To learn more about the District SSO Certification process, see [District SSO Certification Guide](/docs/district-sso-certification-guide)

Through this integration type, the application receives **user first name, last name, and email address**.

### Rostering (Secure Sync)

**Secure Sync** integrations are managed by district administrators. Your application can be added through the _Request Application_ page of the district dashboard. This integration will allow you to pull district, school, user, and enrollment data into your application through the Clever API as long as the district has chosen to share that data.

Through this integration type, the application can receive **user personal and demographic data as well as rostering data.**
