### What's Clever?

Clever offers rostering and Single Sign-on for hundreds of applications. We serve 70% of schools in the USA, saving teachers and students time so they can focus on learning, not on getting signed in or updating accounts. We work with any Student Information System (SIS) either via direct integration or SFTP automation.

For developers, integrating with Clever's APIs means your software can be deployed in nearly any school district, with no additional development or integration work.

### Creating Your Development Application

The first step is to [sign up for your development application](https://apps.clever.com/signup). By default, all applications are set up to access SSO only - if you need access to Secure Sync (rostering), reach out to integrations@clever.com.

Your development application is designed to be used with a sandbox district environments - you will not be able to connect live district data until your application is [Clever certified](/certification-overview). **Clever certified** means you've met a set of core dev requirements so your application is set up for success and ready to start connecting to live school districts.

If you are building an integration for multiple applications, please reach out to us at integrations@clever.com for support in provisioning a multi-application environment.

### SSO into the Applications Dashboard

By default, Clever manages access to the applications dashboard by creating accounts that allow users to set individual passwords. If you would like to configure single sign-on for your organization to better manage access to your application settings, please contact our team at [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#aac3c4decfcdd8cbdec3c5c4d9eac9c6cfdccfd884c9c5c7).

SSO into the applications dashboard is configured via a SAML connection. While setup and testing of the connection is being done, we can continue password access for your admin users. After verifying that the connection is working correctly, password logins can be disabled to ensure all access is managed through SSO.
