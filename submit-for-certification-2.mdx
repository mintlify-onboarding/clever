## Library

Once you are certified, we will clone your **development** application account to create your **production** application account. You will find your **production** account in the dropdown at the top of your dashboard. Our team will launch your application in the Clever Library. You will then need to take the following steps,

1. Update your integration to use your production app credentials at **Settings**.
2. Verify that your redirect URIs point are correct and secured with HTTPS at **Settings >> Instant Login**.
3. Test logins for each supported user type with your production configuration.

**Once you're live:**

* Teachers will be able to install your application in the Clever Library. [For Teachers: What is the Clever Library](https://support.clever.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013488672-For-Teachers-What-is-the-Clever-Library-).
* Your application will be added to Cleverâ€™s [application gallery](https://clever.com/app-gallery) within a week.

## District SSO & Secure Sync

Once you are certified, we will clone your **development** application account to create your **production** application account. You will find your **production** account in the dropdown at the top of your dashboard. You should see a **Go Live** wizard that will walk you through the steps of preparing to go live.

Once you've clicked through the wizard, your application will be Live on Clever! 

**Once you're live:**

* District administrators will be able to add your application to their dashboard
* You can invite districts to connect
* Depending on the options you select in the **Go Live** wizard, your application may be searchable in the district dashboard and may be showcased in Clever's [application gallery](https://clever.com/app-gallery).
