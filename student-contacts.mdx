title: "Student Contacts and Guardians"
---

The user record type `contacts` represents a guardian that is associated with one or more students.

The reliability, formatting, and source of student contact information vary depending on the underlying SIS or approach used to communicate this data to Clever.

> 📘
> 
> In v3.0 of our Data API, contacts will now be returned as a user within the district. All contacts will be associated with at least one student but can be associated with multiple. The student\_relationships field will provide an array response for every relationship the user has within the SIS (e.g. if a user is listed as parent to two students and an aunt to another, they will have one Clever ID but will receive 3 values in `student_relationship` response).
> 
> The full contact name will be stored in the `last_name` field of the user object. This decision was made based off of the way contacts have been historically ingested in Clever and stored in SISs.

### The Contact User Object

For a list of attributes and a sample response, please refer to [the Contacts section of Clever's Data Model](/docs/data-model#section-student-contacts).

### Student Relationships

`student_relationship` will return an array of 3 fields: `relationship`, `student`, and `type`. A contact will have a single `student_relationship` for every instance they appear as a contact within the SIS. 

### Keeping Contacts stable

It's important to note that the stability of a contact's Clever ID is dependent upon whether that contact has the `sis_id` field populated in a district's SIS.

* If the contact record _does_ have an `sis_id`, the contact will retain the same Clever ID when any contact info changes (for example, `phone`, `email`, or `name`). The only case where a contact’s Clever ID will change is if that contact’s `sis_id` changes (similar behavior to a student or teacher record).
* If the contact record _does not_ have an `sis_id`, **any change to contact data will delete the contact record and create a new one** with a new corresponding Clever ID.
* Not all SISes have `sis_id` for contact data. In other cases, the field may exist but is not populated. If you find that districts you work with are missing `sis_id` for contact data, we recommend you contact the district directly or work with our [districts team](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4e2a273d3a3c272d3a3d0e2d222b382b3c602d2123) to populate this field.

### Accessing Contacts

> 📘

> Processing student\_relationships
> 
> Contact information is especially sensitive for privacy and security purposes. Please ensure that the correct `relationship` is tied to the correct student when assigning privileges in your database.

### Syncing contacts first

If your application focuses on contact data, you should sync through all users within a district [GET /users](/reference/getcontacts) or add a ?role parameter to filter for contacts. You will then be able to retrieve associated students given a Clever ID by using [GET /users/{id}/mystudents](/reference/getcontactsforstudent).

### Contact data by student

Clever has offered support for retrieving contact data by student for some time. Given a Clever ID for a specific student, you can retrieve a collection of the contacts associated with that student using [GET /users/{id}/mycontacts](/reference/getcontactsforstudent).

This approach is not recommended for applications requiring all contact data within a district, but works well for ad hoc access patterns.

> ❗️
> 
> Please note: If the contact does not have an `sis_id`, then the contact's Clever ID is not stable - if any information changes on the contact record, the record will receive a new Clever ID.
> 
> Conversely, if the contact has an `sis_id`, the Clever ID will remain stable even if data changes on the record.

### How Contact data varies

In most cases, Clever developers never need to worry about the underlying SIS a district uses.

Due to the wide variance in SIS support for contact records, we recommend applications making extensive use of Contacts data to be aware of these particulars and to be extra tolerant of unusual formatting as Clever does not normalize all data from these fields.

### SFTP

Districts using our SFTP upload feature can share student contacts as part of the `students.csv` upload. The following fields are supported:

| contact field | SFTP spec field       |
| ------------- | --------------------- |
| name          | contact\_name         |
| type          | contact\_type         |
| relationship  | contact\_relationship |
| phone         | contact\_phone        |
| phone\_type   | contact\_phone\_type  |
| email         | contact\_email        |
| sis\_id       | contact\_sis\_id      |

Limitations: Using SFTP limits the number of contacts a student can have 5 contacts maximum. No custom mappings are supported.

### SIS-Managed Auto-Sync

**Limitations**: Contacts field support varies district-to-district. 

* `contact_relationship` is often missing and sometimes you may find `contact_type` containing data you'd typically look for in `contact_relationship`
* `phone_type` cannot be set
* `contact.sis_id` is supported for Infinite Campus, IC OneRoster API, Skyward, and Skyward API only

Limitations: Contacts information from iNOW can sometimes cause sync issues with Clever. For districts experiencing these issues, contact information may be missing entirely. Districts can help alleviate these issues by using our SFTP upload approach instead.
