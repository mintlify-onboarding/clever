> To use OpenID Connect with Clever and receive identity tokens, you must first contact [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fc959288999b8e9d889593928fbc9f90998a998ed29f9391) to have your application account appropriately configured.

  
If you are building out an OIDC SSO integration yourself, the implementation will be exactly like that of the [OAuth Flow](/docs/oauth-implementation) with the key difference being the receipt of an **identity token** and access to the **userinfo endpoint**. 

  
### Working with Third-Party Authentication Services

  
One of the benefits of OpenID Connect is that it specifies a standard way for identity providers to share configuration information, which means that connecting with any third-party authentication service only requires providing a few key details.

  
### The Discovery Endpoint

  
An OIDC compliant provider such as Clever shares necessary information about their requirements at something called the discovery endpoint. Clever's discovery endpoint is:

  
`https://clever.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`

  
Even this endpoint is set up according to a standard format, so in many cases all you need to know is that Clever supports OIDC and the issuer is `https://clever.com`.

  
The discovery endpoint tells any authentication service where and how to kick off the authentication process, get tokens, and verify the tokens.

  
### An Example Configuration

  
Setting up OIDC with most authentication services usually only requires filling out a few fields. This example is for AWS Cognito, but the required fields should be similar for many other providers:

Example OIDC configuration for AWS Cognitio

  
* **Provider name:** this can be anything you'd like to use, but "Clever" makes a lot of sense here!
* **Client ID:** your application's Client ID, found on the Clever application dashboard
* **Client secret:** your application's Client secret. This is required for authenticating with Clever
* **Attributes request method:** Clever supports both POST and GET
* **Authorize scope:** Clever manages scopes through application configuration, so this is not required by Clever. However, some authentication services may still require a value of openid at a minimum
* **Issuer:** this is used to make a call to the discovery endpoint to grab the rest of the information needed to connect with Clever
