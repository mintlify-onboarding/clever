### Related objects

The district object only has `name`, Clever `id`, `mdr_number`, and `nces_id` (if assigned) of the district in question. You'll need to use separate endpoints to access the district's data.

* For example, since each token will give you access to only a single district, you should use `https://api.clever.com/v3.0/schools`.
* Although courses, terms, and users with roles of contacts, school admins, and district admins are associated with a district, there is no relative link returned for these users on the district endpoint.

Instead, you can use:

* [/terms](/reference/getterms)
* [/courses](/reference/getcourses)
* [/users](/reference/getusers)
