title: "Library, Single Sign-On, and Secure Sync rostering"
---

When you set up your integration with Clever, you have three integration options:  
The three options are:

1. District Single Sign-on (SSO)
2. Rostering (Secure Sync)
3. Clever Library

Here are the key differences between a Clever Library and a District integration. When you sign up for a dev app, your app will have Library (Classroom) scopes by default. Please reach out to [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#315041415d58525045585e5f1c585f45544354424571525d544754431f525e5c) to upgrade your dev app to rostering scopes.

### Sensitive Data Fields

 **Accessing Sensitive Fields**
 
 _Sensitive data fields such as IEP\_status, ELL\_status, and FRL\_status require additional scopes to access. A Secure Sync integration is also required to access the fields. If you'd like to enable these fields, please reach out to [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1f76716b7a786d7e6b7670716c5f7c737a697a6d317c7072) for assistance._

### Library (Classroom) Rostering and SSO

### What is the Library integration experience?

When a teacher clicks on a new app in the Clever Library, or via the ‘Sign Up with Clever’ button, the teacher is prompted with a consent screen to authorize Clever sharing their section (class) data with the app. Once authorized, Clever redirects the teacher to your app and you facilitate the OAuth Single Sign-On flow, using API calls to query for the user’s identity and classroom information. The teacher’s account is provisioned immediately, and the teacher is logged in to a free or freemium experience with their section and student data populated. The app is added to the [Clever Portal](https://clever.com/products/sso) for the teacher and their shared students, so those students can also log in to the app.

There are two entry points into your application that facilitate the teacher sign up process: 

1. Teachers who find you through the Clever Library and click “Install".
2. Teachers who click “Sign Up with Clever” button on your website’s teacher signup page.

### What data is shared?

If the teacher consents, your application will be authorized to access the following limited set of data fields for class information **_only belonging to that teacher_**. You'll use this data to automatically create user accounts and set up classes to make the signup experience as smooth and seamless as possible.

**Teacher object data**

* Clever ID - globally unique and stable ID for each user, created by Clever
* Name (first, middle, last)
* Email

**Teacher’s shared sections, as primary or co-teacher**

* Clever ID
* Name
* Section\_number
* Teachers
* Students
* Subject (normalized to a set of possible values)\*
* Grade (if available from the SIS)\*

**Student object data in those sections**

* Clever ID (this is not sid\_id or student\_number; it’s a GUID generated by Clever)
* Name
* Grade (if available from the SIS)\*

### Sandbox Data

Even though your dev app comes with a pre-populated, pre-created sandbox district, it’s important that you test with a demo teacher from a district in Clever that is **_not connected at the district level_** to your development app. This will provide a representative test of a signup experience from a Clever teacher who is not currently shared by a school or district.

Also, note that school and district administrators **do not have permissions** to log in to your application via Clever Library, as a teacher is limited to only sharing his/her classroom data. Administrators must be shared at the district level to access an application.

 Normalized Fields
 
 Clever normalizes certain fields to a defined set of possible values:

 <Warning>
 
 **Accessing the District and School Data with Library (Classroom) scopes**
 
 You will not be able to access District or School level data with your default Library (Classroom) scopes. In order to gain access, please reach out to application-interest@clever.com
</Warning>
### District Rostering and SSO

Secure Sync allows you to access information about users and provision accounts in advance, so you can use that time to improve your core product. If you need access to Secure Sync, reach out to application-interest@clever.com.
### What is the district experience?

District administrators will be able to search for your application in the district dashboard and then scope access to all users within the district. With a district-level integration, your application can be scoped to all users who require access within a district. Once the data is shared, all scoped users data will be available via the district-app token so you will be able to roster and provision accounts at scale. 

There are three ways a user can log in to your application using Instant Login: the Clever Portal, Instant Login links, and Log in with Clever buttons. Your integration should be able to handle logins from any of these sources.

1. Clever Portal - Many districts use the Clever Portal as the primary launch point into their applications.
2. Instant Login Links - Some districts prefer not to use the Clever Portal, but still want to use Instant Login to access their applications. To support this, Clever built [Instant Login links](https://support.clever.com/hc/en-us/articles/205546348) which are links that can be embedded anywhere and are used to log a district's users in to a specific application through Instant Login.
3. Log In With Clever - Users will also often attempt to log in from an application's site directly, not using any portal. To allow users to use Instant Login to authenticate, you can embed a "Log in with Clever" (LIWC) button on your website.

### What data is shared?

Secure Sync gives full access to roster information - student-teacher associations and classroom-level data with OAuth tokens you can retrieve from your App Dashboard or via [our API](/reference#gettokens). Upgrading to [District Certification](/docs/sync-certification) allows you to access the entirety of the Data API, our [matchmaking tools](/docs/onboarding#section-matchmaker), [Data Browser](/docs/il-testing#section-secure-sync-only-il-debugging-tools) and more. [Our schema](https://clever.com/schema) outlines the full list of available fields in Clever.
