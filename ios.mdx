Clever's iOS application allows users to log in to applications - even native iOS applications - with any IDP, including Clever Badges!

### My application does not support users on iOS

No worries! If you don't support users on iOS, email [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#84edeaf0e1e3f6e5f0edebeaf7c4e7e8e1f2e1f6aae7ebe9). We will disable logins from our iOS application.

Additionally, please make sure your primary redirect URL detects whether the user is logging in on an iOS device and displays a page telling them iOS is not supported - this will help appropriately route users who attempt to log in from the mobile web.

### I don't have a native iOS app, but my application supports mobile browsers on iOS

Great! There's not much additional work needed to make this work.

Ideally, your primary redirect URL should either be optimized for mobile or detect that a user is on an iOS device and redirect them to the mobile-optimized experience.

### I have a native iOS app

Awesome! Check out [Instant Login into Native iOS Apps](/docs/il-native-ios) for instructions on getting integrated.
